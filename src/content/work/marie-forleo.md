With over 1M YouTube subscribers and endorsements from Oprah and Richard Branson, Marie Forleo stands alongside peers like Seth Godin, Tim Ferriss, and Elizabeth Gilbert in shaping the conversation around entrepreneurship and personal growth. I joined during a pivotal platform transformation to unify her digital ecosystem‚Äîdesigning an experience that empowered women to move from inspiration to taking action, and begin their entrepreneurial journey.

#### üß© The Challenge

MarieForleo.com had grown organically across multiple channels‚Äîblog content, a YouTube show (MarieTV), and several course microsites‚Äîeach with its own structure and flow. As the platform evolved, there was a need to create a unified ecosystem that could scale and guide users more intentionally.

The goal was to design an experience that moved first-time entrepreneurs from discovery to action‚Äîbuilding the trust, confidence, and readiness to enroll in their first course.

#### üë©‚Äçüíª My Role & Contributions
* Information Architecture Strategy: Audited all major site properties and developed a connected structure that linked blog content, video episodes, course offerings, and community tools into a single navigational system.
* Journey Mapping: Mapped the path from discovery to action‚Äîdesigning flows that helped first-time entrepreneurs build the trust and confidence needed to take their next step.
* Experience Mapping & Content Strategy: Defined 45+ low-fidelity responsive wireframes and annotated flows focused on guiding users from discovery through decision-making, with clear goals for each section of the page.
* Discovery & Onboarding Optimization: Tripled entry points to MarieTV and introduced new onboarding features for high-traffic pages‚Äîhelping first-time visitors discover relevant content and take action.
* Unified Multi-Channel Experience: Connected editorial, video, and learning content into a seamless journey‚Äîhelping users move fluidly from inspiration to education to enrollment.
* User-Centered Learning Design: Applied scaffolding principles from educational psychology to guide users through a thoughtful learning journey‚Äîreducing overwhelm and encouraging self-directed exploration.
* Scalable UX Foundation: Delivered a long-term architecture that enabled sustained platform growth‚Äîincluding evergreen product launches, seasonal promotions, and international reach.

#### üìà Results & Impact
* Lasting Structural Impact: Much of the information architecture I created remains in use nearly a decade later, continuing to shape how users navigate the platform and engage with Marie‚Äôs content.
* Deeper Engagement with Video Content: Tripled the entry points to access MarieTV, significantly increasing exposure to educational video content.
* Improved Onboarding at High-Traffic Entry Points: Boosted clarity and conversion by welcoming organic blog visitors with new elements that introduced Marie‚Äôs mission and offerings.
* Designed for Scale: Equipped the business with a UX structure ready to support future expansion‚Äîincluding new content formats, programs, and global student growth.

#### üí¨ Reflection

This project came just two years after launching my own startup, where I saw firsthand how overwhelming it can be to take that first step into entrepreneurship‚Äîespecially without clear guidance or relatable tools. Bringing that perspective to Marie Forleo‚Äôs platform gave me a deep sense of purpose: helping others feel empowered, informed, and capable of starting something on their own terms. Years later, I‚Äôm proud that the systems I designed continue to support that mission.
