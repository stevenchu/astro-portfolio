# Case Study: Building Accessible, Scalable Color Theming at Bose

## Problem Definition

Historically, Bose used a black-and-white color scheme, but with the latest rebranding—*Sound Is Power*—we introduced over 40 expressive color themes using tonal and analogous color pairs. Designers gained flexibility, yet with only six tones per color, creating accessible variations for UI states (like hovers and presses) was challenging. When designers selected the next-closest tone, the shifts were so large that many combinations failed WCAG AA contrast standards, as confirmed in an accessibility audit.

The existing workaround was to default hover and press states to a white background. While this preserved accessibility for themes with dark text, the workaround didn’t translate the brand’s new visual identity for UI. For themes using light text, contrast requirements now failed, rendering these themes unusable and limiting options for the creative team.

## Initial Solutions and Experiments

To address these challenges, I experimented with a tinting approach inspired by Material Design. By using an opacity layer to modify the background color, I was able to generate dynamic shades to represent UI state changes without adding hardcoded values to our variables table.

<div class="two-column">
  <div>
    - In test one, I used the two colors in the pairing (e.g., primary, on-primary) to tint each other. While this maintained vivid colors and didn’t introduce any new variables, 58 of 240 cases didn’t pass contrast requirements with this approach.
  </div>
  <div>
    - In test two, **white or black opacity layers** reduced failures to 44 of 240 cases but created washed-out colors.
    - In test three, **gray tint layers** halved failures to 22 out of 240 but left similarly desaturated colors.
  </div>
</div>

An idea to get us to the finish line was to use custom color values for the remaining combinations. While this sounded like a quick solution, it meant adding two token fields to store hover and pressed state values for every theme. I wanted to avoid introducing maintenance complexity so we could keep our color theme table and primitives file as a clean source of truth.

Our end users were the creative team who would be applying these color themes to their work. They would add new themes too, and I wanted to keep that process simple with dynamically generating alternate color values.

## Blend Modes Solution

To preserve tonal integrity without desaturation, I proposed blend modes, which allow direct manipulation of hue, saturation, and lightness. Based on my experience with both Photoshop and coding, I knew CSS blend modes were widely supported across browsers.

The `plus-darker` blend mode excelled in creating rich midtones and achieved AA contrast requirements for all 240 of our button theme states. Success!

> **Note:** CSS browser support for `plus-darker` blend mode was only available on Safari.

As a fallback, I found two solutions using classic blend modes:

- **Darken** achieved 100% AA compliance for our themes but lacked richness in color.
- **Multiply** created rich colors but failed AA in 3/240 cases. However, all 3 cases were local to one specific color pairing, and we could flag using that one.

## Impact and Lessons Learned

The blend mode approach minimized design debt by simplifying the maintenance of our color variables. By not adding extra hardcoded values, the system remains lightweight and easier for both UX and creative teams to use consistently. This method helps future-proof the design system, allowing it to grow without overwhelming maintenance demands.

Through the process of this challenge, I put into action the value of finding universal, reusable solutions. Accessibility requirements often encourage simplicity, and our goal of building a scalable design system reinforced the importance of avoiding one-off implementations in favor of systematic solutions.

## Outcome Summary

Ultimately, this exploration helped us identify a fallback solution with blend modes that maximizes color integrity and accessibility without introducing maintenance burdens or custom overrides.
